Lesson 08 Assignment: Django Addons & Security

I added two enhancements:
<ul>Django All-Auth
Users can login with their Facebook credentials (or sign up for a new account).
I also added Like and Share buttons, but they won't work while the site is in development.
<ul>Django ModelForm
I created a form for users to enter a new blog post.
I also created a button for this on the home page.
